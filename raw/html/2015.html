						<h2>A weekend where you can become anyone, and anything can happen!</h2><br>
						<h3>14th-16th August, Auckland, New Zealand</h3>
						<p>Chimera, New Zealand's original and largest larp convention, is here for its eighth year and is eager to welcome old hands and new faces alike for another jam-packed weekend of playing pretend! Last year, Chimera played host to 27 high quality larp games, including three fantastic flagships, and larpers from around the country.</p>
						<p>Since its inception in 2008, Chimera has spawned three sibling larp conventions across New Zealand. Hydra, the Wellington larp conventions, ran its fourth successful event this year in April in Wainuiomata. Last year saw the inaugural Phoenix larp convention in Christchurch, and Medusa larp convention in Hamilton, both excellent and exciting events bringing together writers and players from across the country. We're so excited to see larpers around the country creating their own convention events to showcase the great writing talent in New Zealand! Chimera 2015 is proud to stand alongside them in the annual line up of larp conventions.</p>
						<p>Returning for it's eighth year, Chimera continues to be a great way for new larpers to meet the community, and for returning larpers to see old friends. Chimera once again sprawls across the familiar territory of Motu Moana Scout Camp, and is excited to present a lineup of both new games and games back by popular demand. Our double flagship this year gives you the opportunity to fly away on a magic carpet into 1001 Nights, or to descend into the dark faerie tale of the Erlking and his famous hunt. This year, at Chimera you can be part of nordic surrealism, anthropomorphic art, the end times in Heaven, a Seussian adventure, the Game of Thrones, the Glittergeddon, a tale of Narnia, Dragonage, a high school ball and more.</p>
						<p>Chimera 2015 is going to be a wonderful event in the larping calendar, so register today and bring your friends!</p>
