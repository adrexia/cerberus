						<h2>Into the Woods</h2>

						<h3>Authors</h3>
						<p>Stephanie and Catherine Pegg</p>
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Characters</h3>
						<p><ul><li>6 Lost Children (protagonists, in play all game)</li>
<li>6 Wolves (antagonists, in play much of the game, will receive GM direction)</li>
<li>2 Wood Sprites (backstage helpers with some minor roleplaying)</li></ul></p>
					
						<hr />

						<h3>Costume</h3>
						<p>We encourage the Lost Children and Wolves to go all out on their costuming, although some of these characters will be more complex than others.  The two Wood Sprites should wear plain black.  Please note: this is a walking game.  You can expect to be on your feet and moving for around two hours.  Please bring good footwear (how it looks with your costume is only a secondary consideration.)  Also be prepared for a range of weather conditions - it could be hot and sunny, cold and wet, both, or anywhere in between, so please bring sunscreen and plan your costume to have a warm waterproof layer and an inner thermal layer in addition to a cooler option.</p>
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Maturity and Expectations</h3>
					<p>This game is recommended for reasonably experienced and proactive roleplayers.  If you're relatively new to larping and would like to play, get in touch, and we'll talk about what you might expect. </p>

	<p> There will also be some forum roleplaying on Diatribe in the weeks leading up to Chimera for which both Lost Children and Wolves will need to be available.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
							<p><i>Once upon a time, you went walking in the woods.  And it was scary and it was exciting and you met a Wolf!  The Wolf wanted you to stay and play with them, but you ran away off the path and got lost.  You've been walking ever since.  You've been walking for a very long time.</i></p>

<p>This is a game about fear, desire, and encountering your own personal wolf.  Oh, and getting lost in the woods.  Game content will be somewhat mature (though not R18).  The players will take the roles of Lost Children from a range of fairy tales who have become lost in the woods and are wandering together - this includes some adult characters.  From time to time they will encounter the Wolf they ran away from, and try to find some resolution with them.</p>

<p>Into the Woods is loosely inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Path_(video_game)">The Path</a> video game although its tone will be less horror-focused. </p>
