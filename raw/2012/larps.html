						<h2>THE LARPS</h2>

	<h3><a href="larp_13_angry_men_with_guns.html">13 Angry Men With Guns</a></h3>
						<h4>By Matt Swain and Jackie Brasfield</h4>
						<p> The quiet little frontier town of Mesquite, New Mexico, 1894. Tensions old and new simmer below the surface; rivalries and alliances are formed and broken with each new day. The town is threatened by an Indian tribe, there are rumours of ghosts in Snake Canyon, and the town is slowly dying since the gold ran out. Can you make a name for yourself in the Old West? </p>
						<hr />	

<h3><a href="larp_32ar.html">32AR</a></h3>
						<h4>By Nick Wolf, Mel Duncan and Thomas Joychild</h4>
						<p>The great experiment of Professor Algernon Charteris has gone awry! Professor Charteris' attempt to link the lands of Britain and India with portals through the Aether has instead opened a gateway to hell, from which demons pour onto The Isles! All is far from well as a group of survivors, guided by Commander M. D. Branke, huddle in hope of rescue at the emergency rendezvous point. Surely the reinforcements of the Army of Allied Nations will be here soon to pick up Princess Charlotte of Prussia, and all the other survivors who have made it here?</p>

						<hr />

	<h3><a href="larp_aunt_beatrice_began_it.html">Aunt Beatrice Began It</a></h3>
						<h4>By Stephanie Cybart</h4>
						<p> One year ago, Beatrice Plumehollow, matriarch of one of one of the oldest and most respectable families of Prince Edward Island, Canada, announced that rather than leaving the much-coveted Plumehollow silver to one of the family members in her will, she would spend the next year observing the members of the family to determine who was most worthy of receiving it.</p>

Supposedly the last innocent age before the teenage transformation takes over.  For various reasons, you have joined a scout group, and this is the first time all of the troop will be meeting. You may know some people from school, or via your parent's friends, but for most of you, you are meeting strangers for

						<h4>By Russ Kale and William Shakespeare</h4>
						<p>Mr. O'Strate's seventh form drama class is putting on A Midsummer Night's Dream, and he's cast you all eerily well in your parts. Life is starting to imitate art...a light, fluffy and overly melodramatic game from the authors of <i>Wreck of the Philemon</i> and <i>Twelfth Night</i>. </p>

						<hr />

	<h3><a href="larp_stars_over_strangeways.html">Stars Over Strangeways</a></h3>
						<h4>By Nik Crombie</h4>
						<p> Welcome to Strangeways Convalescent Home. Comfortable, quiet and offering a good quality of care for invalids, at quite a reasonable cost. It is sometime between the two world wars, and money is tight, so it has no shortage of residents. This despite its isolated location; the nearest town is about an hour's drive away. Strangeways itself is a neat little Victorian building that sits on the cliffs overlooking the cold, rocky sea. Despite its outward appearance of tranquillity, Strangeways has gained a troubling reputation. Strangeways itself used to belong to the Strangeways family, but passed into private ownership after the death of the family heir in The Great War; one of many Strangeways to meet an early end. But there has always been something not quite right about Strangeways. </p>

						<hr />

	<h3><a href="larp_tournament_of_champions.html">Tournament of Champions</a></h3>
						<h4>By Derek Tomes</h4>
						<p> Hear yea, hear yea, hear yea! Be it known to all men and women who profess excellence in skill at arms, that on Saturday the 25th of August, at one hour past noon, there shall be a coming together of like-minded people. These stalwart warriors will compete on foot, with sword and shield, axes and maces, single sword and great weapons.

That person shall have earned the title of "Tournament Champion, Chimera 2012."</p>
						<hr />

	<h3><a href="larp_worlds_end.html">World's End</a></h3>
						<h4>By Madeliene Judge and Ivan "Vanya" Essin</h4>
						<p> This is the year when the world comes to an end. Again. Well, this it is for real. It had almost happened before, in Maya when the demons arrived, in England when the great fire burned. Events so catastrophic that they were thought to herald the end of the world. Guess what...? They did. At the tavern at the end of the world a strange assortment of people find themselves stranged, out of time and far from home. What has brought these strangers together? Maybe they just won the front row center seats to see the Apocalypse in its' full splendour. </p>
						<hr />

	<h3><a href="larp_welcome_to_sunny_valley.html">Welcome to Sunny Valley</a></h3>
						<h4>By Cheryl Frederick</h4>

						<hr />
	<h3><a href="larp_the_working_quarter.html">The Working Quarter</a></h3>
						<h4>By Ivan "Vanya" Essin and Porl Bowdler </h4>
						<p> A year ago, there was a country, now that country no longer exists. That is just politics, but what happens to the people when everything they knew crumbles around them, when everything that supported them is gone? War heroes selling their medals. Homeless bums with degrees in nuclear physics. Set during the Perestroika period in Russia, this game looks at the consequences of what was considered as one of the greatest victories of Democracy on the people who had to live through it.</p>
