						<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>One year ago, Beatrice Plumehollow, matriarch of one of one of the oldest and most respectable families of Prince Edward Island, Canada, announced that rather than leaving the much-coveted Plumehollow silver to one of the family members in her will, she would spend the next year observing the members of the family to determine who was most worthy of receiving it.</p>

<p>And oh, what a year it's been! In their determination to impress Aunt Beatrice, some of the members of the family have been inspired to new, ever more presumptuous heights of virtue- Always in the view of Aunt Beatrice, of course. The petty competition that has arisen has provided enough fodder to fuel the gossip at local tea parties and sewing circles for years to come. Some of the family members don't necessarily care who gets the silver (of course, to keep up appearances this isn't something they'd ever admit to publically), but curiosity has gotten the better of them and nontheless they've shown up in hopes that even if they aren't the Chosen One, neither is one of their personal rivals.</p>

<p>Aunt Beatrice is going to announce her choice today, and everyone is tense with anticipation. Of course, she won't just announce who she's chosen and let everyone get on with their lives- No, everyone's to be subjected to a nice little family get-together, where they'll be expected to behave civilly and pretend that they're there because they actually like Aunt Beatrice. It's almost as if the old bat is determined to manipulate the family for her own entertainment...</p>
