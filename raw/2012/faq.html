						<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
						
					<h3>
                        
                        <h3>I have chosen my games, when do I find out which games I am in?</h3>
						<p>Once you make your game selection, your form will be manually processed by a real live person. It takes about two weeks to finalise game rosters after the initial wave of game selections. Therefore, please allow at least two weeks to be sent your game confirmation email.</p>
						
						<hr />
                        
                        <h3>I have selected my games, but I have changed my mind about what I want to play.</h3>
						<p>You can email chimera@nzlarps.org with your revised choices. We prefer that you email us with your revised choice instead of filling out a second form.</p>
						
						<hr />
                        
                        <h3>When do I have to pay by?</h3>
						<p>Popular games often fill up fast, so to ensure your spot, make sure you make payment within 4 weeks of receiving your game confirmation in order to keep your place in the games you selected. Players will not be cast in games (i.e. receive characters) until payment has been received. This reduces stress for our Game Masters who are assured the people they have cast will turn up on the day, and allows you to secure your place in the games you want!</p>

						<hr />

					<h3>I would like to run a game at Chimera, how do I do this?</h3>

<p>Because our timetable for Chimera 2012 is already locked in, we are only accepting submissions for Chimera 2013. Make sure you follow Diatribe for announcements on what sort of games we require.</p>

<hr />
                        
                        <h3>I'm shy and have never done this before, is Chimera a good event for me? </h3>
						<p>Yes, without a doubt! Chimera is the perfect first event, as it lets you dip your toes into a lots of different styles of larping, and introduces you to the community. The Chimera Team is always happy to answer any and all questions you have (no question too silly!) and the community is very welcoming to newcomers. It's a great way to make new friends and try something new. </p>

						<hr />
                        
                        <h3>What is a 'Lucky Dip' pass?</h3>
						<p>For those who feel like a roleplaying challenge, or just want to be surpised with their game choices, we are trialing a new form of Chimera attendance. For a reduced Chimera weekend attendance price of $25, you will be put into your games two weeks before the convention to help fill vital casting gaps. You could end up playing anyone in anything! It's the ultimate roleplaying and costume challenge. There are a maximum of 10 lucky dip places available.</p>

	<hr />
                        
                        <h3>How is the voting done for prizes?</h3>
						<p>After every round, your Game Master will distribute voting forms for you to nominate whom you thought was the Best Roleplayer, whom you thought had the Best Costume and for original games, a score on the game writing. Make sure you vote after each round to show your appreciation for those that made stand out moments for you in the game, and for the hardworking game writers who put the game together! Additionally, we'll be asking people to vote for people they feel show good spirit, anyone that you think has gone above and beyond to make your convention experience awesome.</p>

<hr />
                        
                        <h3>I don't own any larp weapons, can I still play in combat larps?</h3>
						<p>All combat larps will provide larp-safe weaponary for their players so do not worry about not owning any.</p>
