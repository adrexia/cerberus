						<h3>Costume</h3>
						<p>The game is based on animals, so players can decide how much they wish to look like their particular character. The world is based on a "Calvin and Hobbs" type set up, animals become anthropomorphic & can talk, they turn back into normal animals when adults and non-believing children are looking. However, when no one is looking, they are all roughly human sized regardless of their normal relative size to each other. Facepainting & possibly ears/noses for costuming, perhaps tails / farm yard type clothes should people want to look like their characters.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>You live in the Free Animal Republic of MacDonald. This is a fascist regime based on the former land of Farmer MacDonald. The Free Animal Revolution, which established the Republic, occurred exactly one year ago and was led by Freddy and Wilbur, two of the farm's wealthy and upstanding pigs.

<p>Originally, MacDonald's farm had two other pigs, Stevie and Orson, but they were killed in an unfortunate wolf-related incident. Wilbur showed up at the farm shortly after the death of Stevie and Orson, and he, along with Freddy, founded the Fascist Party and led the Revolution, driving the MacDonalds off the farm and freeing the animals from oppressive human rule. The animals rejoiced, because after Old MacDonald died (three years ago), New MacDonald was a lot meaner.</p>

<p>Freddy and Wilbur are led by a friend of theirs named Big Bird. Big Bird only talks to these two pigs, and nobody else ever sees him, but he is constantly watching over the FARM.</p>

<p>Rumors persist of a criminal underground led by a shadowy figure known only as Chicken Little; however, Don Little, if he indeed exists, remains unknown to most and unapprehended by the state.  If Little exists, there may be some truth to the rumors that recreational use of Whey is on the rise among citizens. Of course, such dangerous substances are contraband here.</p>

<p>Today is the first anniversary of the Free Animal Revolution. Accordingly, festivities are being held at the state mansion (barn). The grand and glorious finale of the evening will be the trial of that notorious traitor, the Big Bad Wolf.<p>

<p>Long live the FARM! </p>
