There's also the small matter that Cyril needs to get married within the next 12 months in order to inherit the family fortune. A game in the style of P.G.

The government of the Terran Colonies has decided that enough time has been spent on negotiations and discussions to allow delegates from the Ch'akta to visit Earth herself in a celebration of the original peace accord signed those five years ago. This spectacular event will be hosted at the New Washington War Memorial Museum. This will be the most momentous event of 23XX since the end of the war! <a href="larp-the-chakta-peace-accord.html" class="more-info">Find out more</a></p>

                        <p>Of all traditional fairy tales that were adapted and censored for children in modern renditions, Snow White has perhaps undergone the most change. Today's bedtime story of an innocent princess, seven happy little men and true love forgets the original undertones of desperation, passion, poverty and sexuality. One cannot tell the true story of Snow White without going back to a time in which men were valued only for their size and stamina, and woman only for their beauty and ability to bear children; a time in which glass was so rare that a polished mirror was truly a frightening thing of magic. <a href="larp-snow-white.html" class="more-info">Find out more</a></p>

					<p>Our big Saturday evening larp <strong>The Gordian Knot</strong> is an original space opera. The Galactic Federation is holding a senate meeting and <strong>The Gordian Knot</strong> is set at the welcoming reception held the night before the Senate meeting. An open-invitation gathering for delegates, citizens and guests (invited or not), and the ultimate opportunity to network, politic, trade and romance.</p> 

<p>Written for 110 players, inspirational sources for this game, and an indicator of setting and scene style include Firefly, Dr Who, Red Dwarf, Dune, Blakes 7, Star Trek, the Borg, Stargate. Babylon 5, the Apollo missions, Battlestar Galactica (new and old) and many more.  However, characters are wholly original.</p>
