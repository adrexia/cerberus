			<p class="p2">Cyrus Crane was one of the wealthiest and most well respected men in Arkham. A brilliant businessman, loving father, and world traveler, Cyrus was the New England ideal. Sadly, this past fall Cyrus went missing following another of his archaeological fancies, reputedly searching for ring of Neolithic standing stones rumored to be in the area. As months went by and he was not found, his grieving daughter and son-in-law took up management of the estate.<br><br>But then, a miracle. Cyrus Crane returned home, and his friends and family were overjoyed to learn of his survival. Severely injured, he was found by a pair of trappers and nursed back to health in the small mountain town of Ipswich. The trauma of the accident had caused Cyrus to suffer from a mild amnesia and a terrible blizzard cut off the already fairly isolated town for the duration of the winter. With the spring thaws Cyrus’ health and memory returned, and he set back for home. <br><br>Now, after this traumatic ordeal, Cyrus has invited all his closest friends to a dinner, to see them once more, in the hopes that the familiar faces will help bolster his still ailing health.</p>
