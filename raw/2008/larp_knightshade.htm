			<p class="p2"><i>Written by Jared Hansen</i></p>
			<p class="p2">Knightshade is a new fantasy adventure, written by Hamilton based larper, Jared Hansen. Chimera is proud to offer the premiere game of Knightshade as part of its line up!</p>
			<p class="p2">The land around the village of Puketane is filled with dread. The animals are skittish and fearful, and in the fields the crops have been found blighted as they grow in a weird parody of how things should be. The air has the charnel smell of rancid burnt flesh.<br><br>Strange lights have been seen moving eerily in the forests and hooded beings have been seen moving about, flitting from shadow to shadow.<br><br>Superstitions and accusations of witchery begin to circulate amongst the villagers. Then the stillborns came, livestock at first, and the results often claimed the mother. Then it started happening in the locals, with the poor fetuses, distorted and malformed, their limbs turned into slimy tentacles or hoofed feet or claws, horns...the mothers often died screaming.<br><br>The fingers began to point and soon, strangers and travelers to the land were found hanging from the trees, with rough rope around their necks.<br><br>Now the news has spread & people now shun the area.<br><br>The village of Puketane, located in the Northern area of Skorland has begun to attract another type of strangers. They are those like you, for good or for ill, those who are drawn to places of woe and need alike. Some will come in groups, many alone, some are lost, some are not, some for profit, some for need...but come they will...<br><br></p>
