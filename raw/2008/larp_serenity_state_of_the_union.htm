   			<p class="p1">Serenity: State of the Union</p>
 			<p class="p2"><i>Second game in the ongoing campaign by David Harrop</i></p>
 			<p class="p2">It's Unification Day! Tall ships (luxury cruiser liners of the black) have entered orbit above Bridgewater, and the celebrities and toursits aboard are seeking to meet the settlers and share in the celebrations to commemorate the Unification of Planets, and the end of the war.<br><br>Entertainment, gambling and a general good time are expected, though out here on the frontier, anything could happen.</p>
 			<p class="p2"><b>Background</b></p>
 			<p class="p2">The game is based on the Firefly tv series and is set in a small frontier town of the planet Lilac.<br><br>The town has been recently upgraded by the Alliance as part of their unification rebuilding plan that began at the end of the war. The town has grown as a result of the 1000 credit resettlement bonus offered to any settlers willing to live there for at least 6 months. Ship crews have also accepted the Alliance shipping deal as part of the registration contract to carry people and cargoes to the new town. Lilac has become the new land of oportunites.<br><br>With the recent activities of the town and its people, several cortex casts about the success of the mayoral elections, a number of infamous criminals being brought to justice, and the discovery of an old lost Independent cargo ship and its contents have put the town on the collective cortex map. The 'verse now watches the place with keen interest to see what will happen next.<br><br>The date for the game is 2520 AD, June the 5th. </p>
 			<p class="p2"><b>Characters:</b></p>
 			<p class="p2">Since Bridgewater and its happenings have made the cortex, the incoming tourists and tenderfeet are expecting to meet some of the more famous characters of the town, so if you have an existing character from the last game and want to play them, they are more than welcome to attend. Pre-written characters are available for new players</p>

 			<p class="p2"><b>Costuming Requirements</b></p>
 			<p class="p2">our costume will depend on the level of affluence your character has. Aim for a combination of Chinese oriental fashion mixed with American Frontier ("old west") Check out firefly.com, the TV series Firefly or the movie Serenity for more ideas.</p2>
