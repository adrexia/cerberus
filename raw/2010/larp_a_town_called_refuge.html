						<h3>More info</h3>
						<p><strong>The War</strong></p>
						<p>The American Civil War has just reached the end of its bloody conflict, but tensions are still high between the victorious North and the defeated South, and disorder rules the town known as Refuge. Once a well known safe haven for anyone on the run from the law but with California's integration into America, Refuge and its outlaw inhabitants find themselves in territory that is no longer neutral.</p>
						<p><strong>The Law</strong></p>
						<p>Now the lawbringers have moved in, trying to impose order to a town built on chaos, and the gangs that rule the town are bristling at the bit to protect what's theirs from the law, and from the upstart new gang that's muscling in. The Sheriff and his brothers are the toughest cowboy family around and they ain't no pushovers.</p>
						<p><strong>The Goldrush</strong></p>
						<p>Gold has put this tiny town on the map, the newly discovered wealth in the hills has drawn the attention of the railroad companies and investors with an intention to clean up the town for the gold diggers, and sell her to the highest bidder.</p>
						<p><strong>The Women</strong></p>
						<p>The women of Refuge don't take kindly to all this upheaval, have banded together and picked up their guns, and looks like the saloon ain't the only place for women these days. Some still cling to the protection of the old gangs though, change won't be all that easy for the Banditas.</p>
						<p><strong>The Showdown</strong></p>
						<p>The Saloon, owned by the founding outlaws of Refuge, is hosting this year's 4th of July celebrations. An army General is here especially for the celebration, said to be hunting the local tribe Injin raiders. This is the event where the bets are, things are going to come to a showdown.</p>
