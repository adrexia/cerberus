						<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
						<p>The Chimera organisational team would like Chimera to be a safe and fun event for all attendees. For this reason, we have adopted the following Code of Conduct for all participants to follow. It is created to ensure the safety, well-being and comfort of all our attendees. Chiefly, we ask that you take responsibility for yourself, look after yourself and others, be responsible with alcohol and do everything reasonably in your power to look out for the enjoyment of others at the event.</p>
						<p>By registering to attend Chimera, you accept this Code of Conduct. If you have any questions about what is stated here, feel free to contact us via the Chimera email address. These terms are written to encourage a positive experience at the event for all.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>nzLARPS Code of Conduct</h3>
						<p>Chimera operates as a project of the New Zealand Live Action Roleplaying Society and as such, follows its  <a href="http://nzlarps.org/conduct.php">Code of Conduct.</a> Everything here is in addition to and does not replace anything in the NZLARPS Code of Conduct.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Late Night Activities</h3>
						<p>Chimera tends to be an exhausting and busy weekend and as such, noise levels after midnight must be kept at such a level that it does not disrupt the sleep of other attendees, or the residences around the venue. There will be a designated 'late night' area and all late night activity is asked to be restricted to this area. This area must be left in a clean and tidy state after each night. Make sure all rubbish and recycling is properly disposed of and the area is ready to be used for larping in the morning. Because of the level of energy required in the weekend, we strongly encourage you to make sure you get enough sleep to fully participate in and enjoy the weekend's activities.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Policy on Alcohol</h3>
						<p>We understand that for many people, Chimera is an event where they see friends that they have not seen in some time and in general considered a fun social occasion. However, attendees are asked to remember that Chimera is a larping event, not a party. Many people have put a lot of time and effort into putting on games and the convention itself. Alcohol is allowed on site for those who are of legal age to drink, but we ask that you drink only in moderation. It is strongly advised that if you are bringing alcohol to consume, that you bring food to consume alongside it.</p>
						
						<p>It is not acceptable to drink to the point where you are forcing others to look after you, unable to function the next day, or causing damage to yourself or the venue. Sharing drinks is friendly and hospitable but if people are already inebriated, consider sharing food with them instead. Know your limitations, and respect other people's. If someone says no to a drink, please respect that. If someone asks you to slow down, please consider what about your behaviour may be prompting them to do so.</p>
						
						<p>It is not acceptable to be drinking during the gaming rounds, and you will be removed from your game if your Game Master, or the Chimera team, deem that you have been drinking.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Consequences</h3>
						<p>Bullying, harassment, theft, and any other behaviour that causes harm to another person or is detrimental to the event will receive a warning, and/or a ban, at the discretion of the Chimera team.</p>
						<p>Excessive drinking, drinking to the point where you are injuring yourself or others, forcing others into a position of looking after you, damaging the venue or in any other way causing detriment to the event or to the ability of others to enjoy the event, will receive a warning, and/or a ban, at the discretion of the Chimera team.</p>
						<p>If an incident is deemed serious enough, Chimera may, at its discretion, not issue a warning before issuing a ban. This is for very serious situations and we sincerely hope there will never be anything of a nature to warrant this measure.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Please Remember!</h3>
						<p>The Chimera team is here to organise a fun larping event. We do not enjoy having to sort out incidents or accidents that are a result of intoxication, harassment or otherwise preventable behaviour. We do not want to ban people, or have awkward conversations. They are not fun for us, and they will not be fun for you. Please don't make us have to come be the 'fun police' -  please make sure you respect the event, the venue and the enjoyment of your fellow attendees.</p>

							<h3>Thank You</h3>
							<p>Chimera attracts a fantastic community of people who routinely go above and beyond to look after other members of the community, whether they are old friends, or brand new ones. 
							<p>From our dedicated welfare team, affectionately known as "The Red Hats", to trained medical professionals of all stripes who have volunteered their skills, to everyone that has ever volunteered to help in an unexpected situation, to everyone that's kept a vigilant eye and spoken up, Chimera thanks you for keeping its community safe. You all rock!</p>
							<p>We are proud that Chimera is a safe and welcoming community, and we hope that this document underpins this existing culture of safety and responsibility.</p>
