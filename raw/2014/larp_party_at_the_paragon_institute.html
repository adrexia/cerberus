						<h2>Party at the Paragon Institute</h2>

						<h3>Authors</h3>
						<p>Thomas Joychild and Stephanie Cybart</p>
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>Life's pretty good at the Paragon Institute, a very exclusive boarding school for the orphans of extraordinary but very obscure humanitarians from all over the world. The facilities are modern, the food's excellent and the Institute's on an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island in the Philippines, so the weather's pretty amazing too. You've grown up together and become family (though some of you are dating, making it a slightly incestuous family), surviving algebra and angst alike as you were comprehensively educated on the bankroll of the United Nations. Now it's time for the the Institute's Midyear Non-Denominational Inclusive Social Event (or MNDISE for short, as the staff insist on calling it). Some of you are graduating at the end of this year and will be leaving the school for the wide open outside world, and this is a celebration of your impending independence. All the preparations are going right, for once; the organising committee hasn't even self-destructed through infighting this time.</p>
						
						<p>Only...there was that night two weeks ago when most of the staff were called to an urgent meeting about a break-in at the main office and came out looking very worried. Last week, each of you found a folder on your laptops containing a message from the student who'd hacked the school's records, and your personal file- the REAL one. The one that tells you who you REALLY are. Or were. Or would be, if a team of time-travelling do-gooders hadn't kidnapped you from your homes as babies, altering history and making the world a better place through preventing you from becoming the warlords and dictators and corrupt CEOs that you otherwise would have been. As it turns out, the Paragon Institute is named aspirationally rather than descriptively...</p>
						
						<p><em>'The Paragon Institute'</em> is based on John and Hank Green's concept of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtATGzpTOFk">Evil Baby Orphanage</a>, originating in their excellent Vlogbrothers You Tube series.</p>

						<h3>Costume</h3>
						<p>The characters are modern teenagers at a school ball type event, not all of them are into formal wear though, so feel free to interpret according to your character.</p>
