						<h2>Chimera 2014 - Saturday Night Flagships</h2>
						
						<a href="larp_secrets_of_the_deep.html"><h3>Secrets of the Deep</h3></a>
						<h4>By Reuben Strom, Rowena Knill, Nikki Brown, Phillip Brown</h4>
						<p>The sunken Kingdom of Atlantis. Its name is whispered as a tale of woe and warning by the surface-folk, a lesson in humility. Yet the proud bloodlines did not perish when the city collapsed. They live still, beneath the waves, hidden from prying surface eyes. The question of how they came to survive the drowning of their great city has thus far gone unanswered. Tonight, it is the anniversary of Atlantis' fall into the depths, and as tradition dictates, the King has opened the doors to his royal halls for all the nobility to gather and feast.</p>
						<p>'Secrets of the Deep' is an original 40-60 player LARP written for Chimera 2014 which takes inspiration from the story of Atlantis. Suitable for all player levels, it contains themes of myth and high adventure.</p>
						<hr />
										
						<a href="larp_dry_spell.html"><h3>Dry Spell</h3></a>
						<h4>By Scott Kelly, Ellen Boucher, Donna Giltrap, Malcolm Harbrow, Paul Wilson</h4>
						<p>It is 1930 and the signatories of the Unseelie Accords have gathered in the NeverNever not far from Chicago, USA for their annual meeting. But everyone has their own agenda, and the balance is fragile. Wizards, vampires, powerful Fae, mobsters, the Bureau of Prohibition- they're all here, along with a few unexpected visitors. Chicago may be dry, but by the end of tonight, the city could well be soaked with blood.</p>
						<p>A game for 60 players, set in the world of Jim Butcher's 'Dresden Files' novels, but no knowledge of the books is needed to enjoy this game.</p>
						<hr />
						
						<a href="larp_party_at_the_paragon_institute.html"><h3>Party at the Paragon Institute</h3></a>
						<h4>By Thomas Joychild and Stephanie Cybart</h4>
						<p>Life's pretty good at the Paragon Institute, a very exclusive boarding school for the orphans of extraordinary but very obscure humanitarians from all over the world. You've grown up together and become family (though some of you are dating, making it a slightly incestuous family). But last week, each of you found a folder on your laptops containing a message from the student who'd hacked the school's records, and your personal file- the REAL one. The one that tells you who you REALLY are. Or were. Or would be, if a team of time-travelling do-gooders hadn't kidnapped you from your homes as babies, altering history and making the world a better place through preventing you from becoming the warlords and dictators and corrupt CEOs that you otherwise would have been.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>Traditionally, Chimera has had one epic sized game in the Saturday night spot, where the whole convention came together to play a game. Last year, Chimera was proud to present the herculean 160 player theatreform, <em>The Rose and the Dragon</em>, written by Ryan Paddy and his dedicated writing team, and arguably the larget theatreform game ever written worldwide.
							<p>This year, to reduce stress on writers, and to give players a chance to play big games from the past they may have missed, Chimera 2014 is offering a choice of three awesome games in the Saturday night flagship space. One of these is a brand new never-before-played game written specifically for this event, while the other two are highly commended games that debuted in Wellington, and are having their first Auckland run at Chimera 2014.</p>
