						<p>Our caterer for this year is Michelle Burt, the regular caterer for our sister convention, Hydra! Menu for 2014 to follow shortly.</p>

						<h3>Prizes and the Wall of Awesome</h3>
							<p>Prizes are being phased out at Chimera. This year, voting will take place only on game writing for original games to continue to celebrate excellence in game writing.</p>
							<p>Chimera continues to encourage the open support of each other's awesomeness across the board - great roleplaying moments of all kinds, cool costumes whether it's something flashy or a really well thought out ensemble of small touches and the many helping hands that make our experiences great. We'd like to encourage you all to contribute often to our Wall of Awesome. We'll have pens and post-its available and we want you to write down and stick up all the really cool things that you see others do, all those moments that make your game. The wall isn't about the 'best' or any sort of competition, it's about a celebration of the abundance of awesome we have.</p>
							<p>For our Saturday night flagships, for each of the two games the GMs will select one player for Game Masters' Choice for Outstanding Roleplaying, as well as Game Masters' Choice for Outstanding Costuming. Players will vote after the game paper forms, on the following three categories:
							<ul>
							<li>Favourite Male Costume</li>
							<li>Favourite Female Costume</li>
							<li>Memorable Roleplayer (you can nominate up to two)</li>
							</ul></p>
							<p>There will be character name/real name lists to assist with the voting process.</p>
							
							<hr />

						<h3>Accommodation</h3>
						<p>There are 84 beds available at the venue. Accommodation is clean scout bunks, with access to bathroom, shower and kitchen facilities. Accommodation is free of charge but priority will be given for those coming from out of Auckland.						</p>
