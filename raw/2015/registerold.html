						<h2>REGISTRATION</h2>
						<hr  />
						<h2>Registration will open on 7pm May 18th 2015.</h2>
						<h3>Before you register</h3>
						<p>Registration for Chimera 2015 will open on May 18th 2015. Before you get started, there's a few important things to note:
						<p><ul>
						<li>Please fill in your real name and correct information. We only need this information to be able to get in touch with you for the event, and to help look after you while you are there.</li>
						<li>Chimera is largely an R16 event with attendees under 16 only allowed by special arrangement. If you are under 16, you and your Mum or Dad will need to get in touch with us via email. We categorically do not allow anyone under 13 but those between 13-16 may be able to attend with a parent or other adult. Some games are R18. These age restrictions will be enforced.</li>
						<li>Those who select on site accommodation will be contacted in July to arrange rooms. Those are able to stay off site are asked to do so to make room for out of towners, or those with no transport options. If you are able to billet friends at your residence for the convention, it would be great if you could. We are expecting to have greater accommodation demand than we have capacity.</li>
						<li>For your first, second and third choices, please be sure to put different games. Putting the same game in all three slots <em>does not</em> increase your chances of getting that game. If you put the same game in more than one choice, the second two choices will be considered 'Lucky Dip'</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
						<p>We are collecting this information for the purposes of running Chimera 2015. As part of the NZLARPS financial reporting process your name and payment details  will be filed with the Auckland committee. Your name, larping experience and contact information will be accessible to GMs so they can contact you about games. They may in turn post your name on a public cast-list or pass your contact information to other players if they need to contact you before a game. Your food preferences will be passed on to our catering and kitchen staff. Allergy information will be used by Chimera staff only in case of a medical emergency. Your information will not be shared with anyone else or used for any other purposes.</p>
						<p>Please note that there will be photographers present at Chimera, and that photos may appear online. If you do not want to be photographed, please discuss this with the photographers over the course of the weekend. Photographs of you at Chimera may appear in thumbnail form on the Chimera website. Photographs of you will not be used for publicity purposes without your permission.</p>
