						<h2>Blood and Iron: Teutonic</h2>

						<h3>Author</h3>
						<p>Kirk Jacinto</p>
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Characters</h3>
						<p>Up to 30<p>
						
						<hr />

						<h3>Costume</h3>
						<p>Medieval styling for different factions. Armour for Teutonic knights, Poland, Holy Roman Empire. Furs and light clothing for Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Tartars/Mongols. Mix of both for Novgorod.</p>
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Factions</h3>
						<p>To the South, the Kingdom of Poland constantly locked in conflict with the pagans in the North suffered a humiliating defeat at Vilnius and now faces invasion by the pagan hordes. Facing defeat, messages were sent to Rome begging for aid, and aid did come in the form of a Crusade. Now they faced the pagan invasion, but also have to compete with the Crusaders who will undoubtedly take the lands that should belong to Poland.</p>
                        <p>To the East, a new army to this region marches; the army of the Order of the Teutonic Knights, Crusaders who have answered the call from Rome to "do God's work" against the pagans of the Baltic states. These soldiers maybe few but they are mighty and there are few that have been able to stand in their path. Added to this the might of the Holy Roman Empire comes in the form of the Emperor himself coming on Crusade. They will bring God's word to the pagans, at the tip of a spear if need be.</p>
                        <p>To the North, the pagan peoples of the Baltic have warred with the the Poles for generations. Their heroic victory over the foolish Poles has resulted in three major events; the first was the unification of Lithuania into a Kingdom for the first time in the history of their tribes, a result of the invasion and their subsequent victory. The second was the pagan invasion of Poland, the third was the resulting Crusade being launched against them. Lithuania now faces extinction at the hands of the Christians and they will need to hold their alliance of pagan tribes together, some of whom have no interest in helping the Kingdom of Lithuania.</p>
                        <p>To the West, the great city of Novgorod rises from its dormancy. Fuelled by the vast economic powers it has harnessed, it has become the trade capital of all of Eastern Europe. Now with the wealth of the region at their hands the Princes of Novgorod have the ability to fuel their ambition and conquer an empire. Still, while they move West to build their empire, they are ever watchful of the East, a shadow descends; rumours of  a great host charges after the sun, waging war against all in their path, such a thing must be rumour.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>As the mist of the Baltic Sea slowly move across the coast of North Eastern Europe the drums of war sound.</p> 
							<p>This larp is equal parts Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, and Command and Conquer. This is a medieval combat larp, with conflicting sides, open diplomacy and hidden agendas. It has as little input from the GM as possible (you guys will really control the game)</p>
							<p> This is a combat heavy larp, and if you're in, you're going to have a hell of a ride!</p>
