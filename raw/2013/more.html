							<h3>Prizes</h3>
							<p>Prizes will be awarded for three major categories across the convention: The People's Choice for Standout Roleplaying, The People's Choice for Standout Costuming, and The People's Choice for Greatest Chimera Spirit. There is an additional prize of Best Spirit, awarded to someone who has gone above and beyond in making Chimera an exceptional experience as voted by the convention goers.</p>
							<p>Contrary to past years, where everyone voted one costume and one roleplayer after the game, there are no number limitations on nominations, and nominations will be open throughout the convention so people can vote for as many or as few people as they wish for each category (except game writing, which is done after each round). For example, if in one game, there was nobody you thought stood out for costume but three people you thought roleplayed well, you can nominate the three for roleplaying and not nominate for costume. People are encouraged to vote as it shows their appreciation for others' efforts but are not forced to. Voting will be done via Google Form - accessible by either smartphone, an internet capable laptop on site or paper slips if necessary.</p>
							<p>For our Saturday night flagship, for each of the four areas the GMs assigned to the area will select one player for Game Masters' Choice for Outstanding Roleplaying, as well as Game Masters' Choice for Outstanding Costuming. Players will vote after the game via smartphones, tablets, computers etc through a Google Form, which will allow us to tabulate results in a matter of minutes, on the following three categories:
							<ul>
							<li>Favourite Male Costume</li>
							<li>Favourite Female Costume</li>
							<li>Memorable Roleplayer (they can nominate up to three)</li>
							</ul>
							People will need to bring their smartphones to the game with them. There will be character name/real name lists. </p>
