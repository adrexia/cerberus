						<h2>Last Spaces Deal - 6 Games for $25</h2>

						<h3>A Special Kind of Lucky Dip Pass</h3>
						<p>We are now down to our last 20 or so spaces at Chimera 2013 and we would love to fill them! Because there are so few choices of game left, we are reducing our weekend price to the lucky dip price as one-off special. You can choose from any of our remaining games and it will only cost $25 for the whole weekend. With weekend catering only costing $30, that's a weekend of catered gaming for only $55.</p>

						<p>The highly popular flagship game from Hydra 2012, this game is set during the Mayan apocalpyse. Costuming is not at all daunting, a good Mayan costume can be put together easily from a poncho, accentuated with touches of leopard ('jaguar') print, a feathered head dress available from Look Sharp stores and some facepaint. Fall of the Jaguar Gods is a highly commended game, with intense interpersonal relationships, politics, and the end of the world.</p>
