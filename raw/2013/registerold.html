						<h2>REGISTRATION</h2>
						<hr  />
						<p>Registration will open for Chimera 2013 on <em>Tuesday 4th June at 7pm</em>. All registrations collected in the first week will be processed at once to give everyone a fair chance at getting into their preferred games.</p>	
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Notes on Registration</h3>
						<p>When registering for Chimera 2013, there's a few important things to note:
						<ul>
						<li>Please fill in your real name and correct information. We only need this information to be able to get in touch with you for the event, and to help look after you while you are there.</li>
						<li>Chimera is largely an R16 event with attendees under 16 only allowed by special arrangement. If you are under 16, you and your Mum or Dad will need to get in touch with us via email. We categorically do not allow anyone under 13 but those between 13-16 may be able to attend with a parent or other adult.</li>
						<li>Those who select on site accommodation will be contacted in July to arrange rooms. Those who are able to stay off site are asked to do so to make room for out of towners, or those with no transport options. If you are able to billet friends at your residence for the convention, it would be great if you could. We are expecting to have greater accommodation demand this year than ever before.</li>
						<li>For your first, second and third choices, please be sure to put different games. Putting the same game in all three slots <em>does not</em> increase your chances of getting that game. If you put the same game in more than one choice, the second two choices will be considered 'Lucky Dip'</li>
						<li>Similarly, if you put "Not Attending" as your second or third choice, be aware that you may indeed be allocated this option if your first choice of game is full. Putting "Not Attending" as your second or third choice does not guarantee you a space in your first choice.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<hr />
